sorry for the long reply I was reviewing your request,

1. the home page
explaining the platform
users to register and to log in, 
logo and picture showing this is a peer to peer lending platform for Africa will do.

register as lender button.
Then lenders will fill out a form


2. I like the profile page and the choice of  menus.My suggestion is; 

Home:  Should show existing lenders already offering credit on the platform.

Profile: 
change the similar businesses to "My opportunities'' here we will be connecting businesses with relevant opportunities in the market like tenders,whos selling what etc,

3.Network:
I like Network; ''Network with members on Paa Leo"  
search button for members you can check their profile and on their profile you can add "add to my network"  
Then users can be able to see members on their network and they can be able to connect on the platform. 

4.I like search for lenders search bar.Keep it!

Keep up the good work,try to stick to the deadline but don't feel unnecessarily pressured ,take your time and do a good job! 

sincerely,
